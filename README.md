# The Effect of Polls in Multiwinner Elections

This repository is to support the paper 'The Effect of Polls in Multiwinner Elections'. <br>
The simulation tool PiMWE (Polls in MultiWinner Elections), introduced in the paper, is further explained and implemented in this repository, specifically in this [folder](https://github.com/LisaEvO/COMSOC/blob/main/case_studies.ipynb). All aspects of the tool can be found in their representative files. 

### Case Study 1: 2023 Dutch elections
The code for Case Study 1 can be found in this [notebook](https://github.com/LisaEvO/COMSOC/blob/main/case_studies.ipynb). The results for this can be found in [results 1](https://github.com/LisaEvO/COMSOC/tree/main/figures/dutch_election). The orginal data that we used can be found in [data](https://github.com/LisaEvO/COMSOC/tree/main/data).

### Case Study 2: polarization
The code for Case Study 2 can be found in this [notebook](https://github.com/LisaEvO/COMSOC/blob/main/case_studies.ipynb). The results for this can be found in [results 2](https://github.com/LisaEvO/COMSOC/tree/main/figures/polarisation).

### Experimenting
If anyone would wish to experiment with the results and adjust the amount per voter type or the amount of parties participating, this can also be done in the [notebook](https://github.com/LisaEvO/COMSOC/blob/main/case_studies.ipynb).
